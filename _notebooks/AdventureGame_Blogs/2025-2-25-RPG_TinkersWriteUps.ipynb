    "\n",
    "### Changing the background details \n",
    "\n",
    "As said before, changing the background will not be too hard. This was done by adding the image of the basement into the images/gamify/ file, then editting the code in GameLevelDesert. Instead of having the background be the desert, I changed the pathway so it pulls from the basement background instead of the desert background. Afterwards, I changed the rest of the code so instead of saying 'desert' for the background, it instead says 'basement'. During this process, I changed the name from GameLevelDesert.js to GameLevelBasement.js. \n",

    "For example: \n",
    "`image_src_basement` to `image_src_basement`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing NPC placement \n",
    "\n",
    "Changing where the NPCS are placed in the level was a bit more difficult to figure out, but I eventually found the code and found the pattern that it does in order to move the NPCS along the width and height of the background. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the NPC data for each of the NPCS, there is an object that was created inside of `const sprite_data_asaka` called `INIT_POSITION` that controlled the NPC's *x* and *y* data, putting them where I code them to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **x** Is the horizontal position of the NPC on the canvas. Increasing the x value moves the NPC to the right, while decreasing the x value moves the NPC to the left.\n",
    "- **y** Is the vertical position of the NPC on the canvas. Increasing the y value moves the NPC down, while decreasing the y value moves the NPC up"

    "## Tinker Two : Changing The NPC Sprites \n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the NPC sprites was similar to changing the background of the game, just with a few more steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to changing the background, I had to add the sprite sheets of the new NPCS into `images/gamify` file in order to put it into the code. Instead of having `sprite_src_tux` in the original code that was given to us, I changed it to `sprite_src_asaka`. Asaka is the name of one of the NPCs. I changed two more NPC's data so it's our NPCs instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, I had to change the configuration for their `orientation` and their `down` since the layout of their sprite sheet was different from the original sprite sheet of the old NPCs. Since the sprite sheets that we have for all of the NPCs are 3x4, in their orientation, I had to change all of them to `orientation: {rows: 4, columns: 3 }`. Then, I changed their down animation to `down: {row: 0, start: 0, columns: 3 }`  which made it so it played through all three sprites in row 0.\n",

There are multiple combinations of answers that the player can choose to respond with.
