    "\n",
    "Since these two are very similar, this part will be going over them both. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was responsible for handling the collision on both levels in order for the player and enemies to collide. With the collision, that would lead to the player dying and the level having to be restarted. In our own game level, there is an enemy Creeper walking around the level. Since we wanted something to happen when the player touches (collides) with the Creeper, we created 'enemy.js', which has it's own collision checks. \n",

    "In each frame, the Enemy updates its visuals ``(this.draw())``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if the enemy hasn’t already “killed” the player ``(!this.playerDestroyed)``, it checks for a collision using ``collisionChecks()``.\n",
    "\n",

    "- If it finds a Player object, it calls ``this.isCollision(gameObj)``.\n",

    "\n",
    "- It sets ``this.playerDestroyed`` to true (so it doesn’t kill the player repeatedly!).\n",
    "- It sets the current level’s ``restart`` flag to true, signaling the game to restart the level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The collision detection is done by calling ``this.isCollision()`` on the Player object, and checking if ``this.collisionData.hit`` is true.\n",
    "The reaction to the collision (like killing the player, triggering level restart, and explosion) is done in ``handleCollisionEvent()``."

When the player interacts with the Villager at the end of the RPG level, a canvas is drawn over RPG. So, it's easy to go from the **platformer** to the **RPG** without having any complicated code that transfers from level to level in the Adventure Game.\n",
    "\n",
