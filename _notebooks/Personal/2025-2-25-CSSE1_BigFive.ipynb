    "In the beginning of this trimester, we needed to create GitHub accounts and repositories in order to get started with our projects. This was my first time using GitHub and in the course of these twelve weeks, I learned more and more about GitHub and where to find certain things. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I learned how to clone repositories into VScode in order to edit them. After that, I learned that I could create commits that go straight to the GitHub repository from VScode. \n",

    "Another example was how to find your personal analytics. Going into your profile and understanding what the green boxes mean, showing that you have been commiting and working on projects."

A JavaScript fundamental that we had to study and understand in order to teach the rest of the class. Not only did we come to learn the topic we taught, classes and methods, but we also learned how to grade and create homework for others. \n",

Not only did we have to make the lesson understandable for others, we had to make it along with each other.

    "A lot of students made special changes to their games. Personally, I changed the color of the background and changed to pngs for the snake and the fruits. I coded a class that contained all the fruits that I wanted to put in the game, them I coded a function that randomized what fruits showed up in the game so that the snake was eating different types of fruits."

    "\n",
    "First, we started with a general idea that would start the game then continued working on it using tinkers that we would want to add to the game. An example of a tinker in our game is the special interaction that was created for one of ours NPCs. We wanted an interaction where there would be two answers for a question and the next question the NPC asks would depend on what the player answered with. "
