    "- **Properties**: These are the values associated with a JavaScript object. A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties. Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods**: These are actions that can be performed on objects. A method is a property that contains a function definition.\n",

    "## Hack Rundown \n",
    "\n",
    "For the hack, I created a Pokemon-themed battle. The Pokemon that are in the simulation are Blastoise, Charizard, and Venasaur. Each of them have different stats depending on the Pokemon. ( Charizard has a faster speed stat because it's a dragon. Blastoise has a high defense stat because it is a turtle. ) Two random opponents are chosen to go against each other, then a random stat between the two Pokemon are compared. One Pokemon's stat will be higher, and whoever has the higher stat will win the battle. This battle simulation is run three times in one round since there are three Pokemon. Then, when the round ends, a Leaderboard will be printed. This displays what Pokemon are still alive, and their current stats. Only the health will change, the rest of the stats are there to show why each pokemon won against its opponent. Eventually, one Pokemon will be left standing. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object Literals in this Hack \n",
    "An **object literal** is a way to define an object directly. It defines a key-value directly in the code, it creates an object and its 'literally' just that object. \n",
    "\n",
    "```js \n",
    "const pokemonStart = {\n",
    "    name: \"Unknown\",\n",
    "    type: \"Unknown\",\n",
    "    health: 100,\n",
    "    attack: 10,\n",
    "    defense: 10,\n",
    "    speed: 10,\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an object literal because it is using the curly brackets. It has hard coded keys and default values, this object is a template for the new Pokemon instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const pokemon = [\n",
    "    new Pokemon({name: \"Charizard\", type: \"Fire\", stats: {speed: 80, attack: 100, defense: 70}}),\n",
    "    new Pokemon({name: \"Blastoise\", type: \"Water\", stats: {speed: 60, attack: 90, defense: 100}}),\n",
    "    new Pokemon({name: \"Venusaur\", type: \"Grass\", stats: {speed: 50, attack: 80, defense: 90}})\n",
    "];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, this is again defining certain values with the curly brackets. The object literals in this situation are the ``speed:, attack:, defense:``\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we look at Charizard, its stats are hardcoded to start as they are. Charizard's speed stat is literally just 80, and will not change for the duration of the rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object Instances \n",
    "An **object instance** is a specific object created from a class or constructor function. It's a usable object with methods defined by a class. \n",
