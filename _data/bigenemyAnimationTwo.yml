      This code applies a visual animation effect to a sprite by changing its CSS styles with a smooth transition.

      <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold">spriteElement.style.transition = 'filter 1s ease-in-out';</span>  
      This line sets a transition so that any changes to the `filter` property will happen gradually over 1 second, using an "ease-in-out" timing function. This makes the visual change smooth instead of instant.

      <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold">spriteElement.style.filter = 'brightness(3) saturate(0)';</span>  
      This line triggers the visual effect. It increases the brightness of the sprite and removes color by setting saturation to 0. This makes it look almost completely white.

      Together, these two lines create a smooth flash, transformation effect when the animation function runs. Fun fact, I found it easier to instead increase the brightness of the Creeper rather than trying to add a white overlay to it. :)
