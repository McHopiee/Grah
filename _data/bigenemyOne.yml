      It may seem like a simple enemy bouncing around your screen, but the more you watch it and interact with it, the more you realize that this creeper has a lot more features than you realized!
      
      <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">Movement:</span> The first thing you notice about the creeper is the fact that it is bouncing back and forth in an invisible box. 

      <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">Animation:</span> After a few seconds, you see the creeper light up for a moment, then go back to its normal state. If you haven't played Minecraft before, this is something creepers actually do in the game! (Sound included).

      <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">Collision:</span> Then, the example shows that when the player character collides with the creeper, they explode into bits! The level then restarts.
